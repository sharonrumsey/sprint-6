What is your site's primary purpose?
--My site is spa services for millenials or for the younger generation as a target - but happily will serve anyone with money.

Who is your target audience?
--Millenials (anyone with money) - also try to cater more to the customers that continually return for services and cater specifically to their needs and discounts or bonuses for returning often for services.

How do you want site visitors to interact with your site?  What experience would you like them to have?
--I want them to get a sense of comfort and safety that they will receive services that match their expectations and that they will benefit from them.  If possible I wish to convey as much as possible that the services they receive will be as "expected" and will more than match their expectations but exceed them.

I want them to visually  remember the site and make returning to the site easy for them without having to remember a long name or funny or odd web address.  Wish to make it easy for them to contact us through mobile device and to make bookings on the fly for themselves, friends and family.

What will you do to make your page accessible?
--Learn more about how to adapt a desktop page or create from the mobile up to the desktop.   It's about "expanding the mobile design" - bit crunching down from a large desktop design, but starting at the small device size and expanding on that.

How will you make your page usable?
--Keep it simple and easy to read.  Use hover on links for a visual image change to give clues to the user. Visually check that the colour scheme is compatible and not a bad contrat of colours on the users eyes.
